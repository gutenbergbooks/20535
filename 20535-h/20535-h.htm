INTRODUCTION</a></h4>


<p>In an address to the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies
at the 1983 annual meeting, Roger Lonsdale suggested that our knowledge
of eighteenth-century poetry has depended heavily on what our
anthologies have decided to print. For the most part modern anthologies
have, in turn, drawn on collections put together at the end of the
eighteenth century and the beginning of the next, when the ideal for
inclusion was essentially that of “polite taste.” The obscene, the
feminine, and the political were by general cultural agreement usually
omitted. Lonsdale is not the only scholar questioning the basis of the
canon; indeed, revisionism is fast becoming one of the more
ingenious--and useful--parlor games among academics. Modern readers are
no longer so squeamish about obscenity nor so uncomfortable with the
purely personal lyric as were the editors at the end of the eighteenth
century. And we are hardly likely to find poetry written by women
objectionable on that score alone. In short, the anthologies we depend
upon are out of date.</p>


<p class = "space">
Among the works that would never have been a source of poems for the
canon, and one mentioned by Lonsdale, was the collection of verse
published in four parts by J.&nbsp;Roberts beginning in 1731, <i>The
Merry-Thought: or, the Glass-Window and Bog-House Miscellany</i>,
commonly known simply as <i>The Bog-House Miscellany</i>. Its
contemporary reputation may be described as infamous. James Bramston, in
his <i>The Man of Taste</i> (1733), mentioned it as an example in poetry
of the very opposite of “good Taste” (ARS 171 [1975],&nbsp;7). Polite
taste, of course, is meaningful only if it can define itself by what it
excludes, and nothing could be in worse taste than a collection of
pieces written on windows, carved in tables, or inscribed on the walls
of Britain’s loos.</p>

<p>Just as the compilers of a modern work, <i>The Good Loo Guide</i>,
were parodying a well-known guide book to British restaurants, so the
unknown authors of <i>The Merry-Thought</i> had some notion, however
discontinuous, of parodying the nation’s polite literature. Were not
Pope and Swift famous for their distinguished miscellanies? What could
<span class = "pagenum intro">iv</span>
be more amusing than a collection of poems that represented a different
poetic ideal--a&nbsp;collection of verse with none of the pretensions to
artistic merit claimed by the superstars of the poetic world--the
spontaneous productions of nonpoets in moments of idleness or
desperation. Apparently some of the inscribers in the bog-houses used
excrement as a medium for--as well as a subject of--their inscriptions.
<i>The Merry-Thought</i>, then, is not even the kind of art that Dryden
attacked in <i>MacFlecknoe</i> and Pope in his <i>Dunciad</i>--the work
of bad poets masquerading as geniuses.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id
= "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> Rather, it is a primitive form of folk
art produced as a more or less spontaneous act of play or passion, and
achieving some small degree of respectability only when practiced by a
respected poet and collected with his more serious verse.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> Like modern
“serial” graffiti, it could function as a form of communication since
the first inscriptions often provoked those who followed to make their
own contributions.</p>

<p>Indeed, one of the more interesting aspects of graffiti is that in an
impermanent form it testifies to the continuance over the centuries of
certain human concerns. Recent studies of graffiti have often focused on
particular modern conflicts between races or nations, on drug problems,
and on specific political commentary.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id =
"tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> But such local matters aside, the content
of modern graffiti is surprisingly like that of earlier periods:
scatological observations, laments of lovers, accusations against women
for their sexual promiscuity, the repetition of “trite” poems and
sayings, and messages attributed to various men and women suggesting
their sexual availability and proficiency. And if the political targets
have changed over the years, many of the political attitudes have
remained consistent. Graffiti is an irreverent form, with strong popular
and anti-establishment elements. As actions common to all classes,
eating, drinking, defecation, and fornication find their lowly record in
graffiti-like form.</p>

<p>On the most basic level, a&nbsp;writer will observe that the
excrement of the rich differs in no way from that of the poor. Thus one
poem, taken supposedly from a “Person of Quality’s Boghouse,” has the
following sentiment:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
Good Lord! who could think,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
That such fine Folks should stink?</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 2, p. 25)</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum intro">v</span>

<p>There is nothing very polite about such observations, and no
pretension to art. These verses belong strictly to folklore and the
sociology of literature, but they suggest some continuing rumbles of
discontent against the class system, the existence among the lower
orders of some of the egalitarian attitudes that survived the passing of
the Lollards and the Levellers. Who were the writers of these pieces?
Were they indeed laborers? Or were they from the lower part of what was
called the “middle orders”? Is there some evidence to be found in the
very fact that they could write?</p>

<p>Graffiti may, indeed, tell us something about degrees of literacy.
One wit remarked that whatever the ability to read or write may have
been at the time, almost everyone seemed to have been literate when
presented with a bog-house wall: “Since all who come to Bog-house write”
(pt.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;26). The traditional connection between defecation
and writing was another comparison apparent to the commentators. One
wrote:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
There’s Nothing foul that we commit,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
But what we write, and what we sh - t.</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 2, p. 13)</p>
</div>

<p>And the lack of some paper or material to clean the rear end provoked
the following sentiment in the form of a litany:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
From costive Stools, and hide-bound Wit,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
From Bawdy Rhymes, and Hole besh - - t.</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
From Walls besmear’d with stinking Ordure,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
By Swine who <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling unchanged">nee’r</ins> provide Bumfodder</p>
<p class = "inset6 nospace">
<i>Libera Nos</i>----</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 4, p. 7)</p>
</div>

<p>Other types of graffiti, however, vary from the very earnest
expression of affection to the nonexcrementally satiric. One of the more
unusual is a poem in praise of a faithful and loving wife:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset3">
I kiss’d her standing,</p>
<p class = "inset4 nospace">
Kiss’d her lying,</p>
<p class = "inset3 nospace">
Kiss’d her in Health,</p>
<p class = "inset4 nospace">
And kiss’d her dying;</p>
<span class = "pagenum intro">vi</span>
<p class = "inset3 nospace">
And when she mounts <i>the Skies</i>,</p>
<p class = "inset4 nospace">
I’ll kiss her flying.</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 3, p. 5)</p>
</div>

<p>Underneath this poem, <i>The Merry-Thought</i> records a favorable
comment on the sentiment. Even more earnest is the complaint of a woman
about her fate in love:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
Since cruel Fate has robb’d me of the Youth,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
For whom my Heart had hoarded all its Truth,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
I’ll ne’er love more, dispairing e’er to find,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
Such Constancy and Truth amongst Mankind.</p>
<p class = "deepset">
<i>Feb.</i> 18, 1725. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 2, p. 12)</p>
</div>

<p>We will never know why she was unable to marry the man she truly
loved; but her bitterness may have been short-lived. Just after this
inscription comes a cynical comment identifying the lady as a member of
the Walker family. And the writer insists that like all women she was
inconstant, since he kissed her the next night.</p>

<p>This cynical approach to love and women dominates <i>The
Merry-Thought</i>. Part three, for instance, contains a poem that reads
like a parody of Belinda awaking in the first canto of Pope’s <i>Rape of
the Lock</i>. The author, identified as W.&nbsp;Overb&#x2011;&#x2011;ry,
presents a realistic morning scene without either the charms and
beauties that surround Pope’s Belinda or the viciousness and focus of
Swift’s similar pictures (see pt.&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;26).</p>

<p>Prevailingly, women are depicted as sexually insatiable, as in a
piece written by a man who takes a month’s vacation from sex to recoup
his strength (pt.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;12). And the related image of the
female with a sexual organ capable of absorbing a man plays a variation
on the vagina dentata theme (e.g., pt.&nbsp;2, pp. 19, 24). A drawing of
a man hanging himself for love raises a considerable debate on whether
such a thing can indeed occur (pt.&nbsp;2, pp. 17-18). In a more
realistic vein, though equally cynical, is the poem on the woman who
complained of her husband making her pregnant so often:</p>

<span class = "pagenum intro">vii</span>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
A poor Woman was ill in a dangerous Case,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
She lay in, and was just as some other Folks was:</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
By the Lord, cries <i>She</i> then, if my Husband e’er come,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
Once again with his Will for to tickle my Bum,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
I’ll storm, and I’ll swear, and I’ll run staring wild;</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
And yet the next Night, the Man got her with Child.</p>
<p class = "inset6">
S. M. 1708.</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 2, pp. 10-11)</p>
</div>

<p>S. M. is clearly unsympathetic to the plight of married women in an
age with only the most primitive forms of birth control.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> The picture of her as a
long-suffering person is undercut by the casual male assumption that
giving birth was not really dangerous and that women make too much of
the pain and difficulty. That women were often forced to go through
thirteen or fourteen deliveries when little thought had yet been given
to creating an antiseptic environment for childbirth is apparently of
little concern to S.&nbsp;M., who finds in the apparent willingness of
the woman to have sexual intercourse one more time sufficient reason for
contempt.</p>

<p>In addition to giving glimpses into social attitudes, <i>The
Merry-Thought</i> has a variety of inscriptions that show the way these
writings functioned. Professor George Guffey, in his introduction to the
first part of this work (ARS 216 [1982], iii-iv), remarks upon the
proposal scene carried on in <i>Moll Flanders</i> between Moll and the
admirer who will prove her third husband and her brother. Such scenes
involving witty proposals and responses cut into the windows of taverns
were real enough at the time. The exchange in part two of <i>The
Merry-Thought</i> is not, however, half so satisfactory. The woman takes
umbrage at her admirer’s suggestions that the glass on which he writes
is “the Emblem” of her mind in being “brittle, slipp’ry, [and]
pois’nous,” and writes in retort:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
I must confess, kind Sir, that though this Glass,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
Can’t prove me brittle, it proves you an Ass.</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(Pt. 2, p. 27)</p>
</div>

<p>Though an easy cynicism about women’s availability and about the
body’s insistently animal functions predominates, there is enough
variety in <i>The Merry-Thought</i> to provide something of a picture of
eighteenth-century society were any future anthropologist
<span class = "pagenum intro">viii</span>
to come upon this volume as the sole remnant of that period. He would
see a society engaged rather more in animal functions than in
intellectual pursuits--a&nbsp;society rather more concerned with
drinking, love, and defecation than the picture presented by the polite
and intellectual literature of the time allowed. But he would also find
in the satirical squibs on Corny, the Cambridge bookseller and printer,
evidence of learning and university life (pt.&nbsp;2, pp. 4-6) as well
as a criticism of opera (pt.&nbsp;2, pp. 14-16). He would see numerous
young men longing for their mistresses to soften their hearts toward
them, and cynical older men who had lost their illusions about love. But
he could also come upon a straight piece of philosophy taken from the
still fashionable Flask tavern in Hampstead (pt.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;24) or
lowly bits of pious folk wisdom (pt.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;10). More often,
however, he would uncover a society in which there was little of the
generalized style that characterizes even the most personal formal
poetry of the period. Many of the writers identify themselves and the
names of the women they love or detest. In short, if these volumes do
little else, they do provide a vivid glimpse into the personal life of
the time, and to that extent an injection of some of these inscriptions
into the anthologies of the period might help in providing a lively and
piquant context for the serious artistic production of writers like Gay
and Swift.</p>


<p class = "space">
The announced “publisher” of this olio was one Hurlothrumbo,
a&nbsp;character drawn from the theatrical piece of that name by Samuel
Johnson of Cheshire (1691-1773). Professor Guffey has proposed that
James Roberts, for whom the four parts were printed, “was almost
certainly the collector of the graffiti” and that the name of
Hurlothrumbo was invoked in order to attract some of the attention that
Samuel Johnson of Cheshire and his play were still receiving two years
after the play’s first performance and publication.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> But Roberts would appear an
unlikely candidate for the role of editor;<a class = "tag" name = "tag6"
id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> I would suggest, rather, the
possibility of a more direct and active connection with Samuel Johnson
of Cheshire: that he was himself likely the compiler of the four parts
of <i>The Merry-Thought</i> and that, whatever the individual versifiers
may have intended, this infamous collection of graffiti--<i>as
collection</i>--shares very closely with Johnson’s other work a spirit
of wild variety, eccentric juxtaposition, and essential anarchism that
is meant to lead, not
<span class = "pagenum intro">ix</span>
to clever parody of polite literature, but to a new, almost apocalyptic
vision of the sublime.</p>

<p>At the first level, <i>Hurlothrumbo: Or, The Super-Natural</i> (1729)
itself appears to be quite simply a parody, in this case of opera in the
form of a work mixing dialogue and song in a manner similar to but much
wilder than Gay’s <i>Beggar’s Opera</i>. Johnson’s apparent takeoff on
the heroics of opera managed to include in its attack a commentary upon
the absurdity of contemporary tragedy as well as some specific
references to those works that aimed at the sublime. Lines like “This
World is all a Dream, an Outside, a&nbsp;Dunghill pav’d with Diamonds”
(48) seem to call the very nature of metaphor into question, especially
when juxtaposed with other delirious lines such as “Rapture is the Egg
of Love, hatched by a radiant Eye” (14) or by songs such as that sung by
the king on contemplating the effects of swallowing gunpowder and brandy
together:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">
Then Lightning from the Nostrils flies.</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
Swift Thunder-bolts from Anus, and the Mouth will break,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">
With Sounds to pierce the Skies, and make the Earth to quake.</p>
<p class = "deepset">
(P. 42)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hurlothrumbo</i> may be mostly nonsense, but from the standpoint
of literary history, it is highly significant nonsense. It represented a
revolt against all dramatic conventions and shared a number of qualities
with graffiti, including the sense of spontaneity.</p>

<p>Had Johnson’s intention been something as relatively uncomplicated as
literary parody he would have achieved some minor fame in a century
which could boast any number of geniuses who had specialized in deriding
the pretentiousness of the more established literary forms, particularly
tragedy, the epic, and the pastoral. But Johnson of Cheshire lacked the
aesthetic distance required of sustained irony and had a grander purpose
in mind. His tradition was not that of the parodist but rather that of
the visionary--the mystic whose tendency is to merge the high and the
low, the sublime and the absurd, within a single work.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> He was not attacking the
extravagant rants of the heroic play as Fielding was to do in his
<i>Tragedy of Tragedies</i> (1731) or reflecting on opera and pastoral
as Gay had done in <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i> (1728); rather he was
trying, however unsuccessfully, to maintain his own work at the highest
reaches of sublimity. He was like one of Pope’s “<i>Flying Fishes</i>,”
who “now and then rise
<span class = "pagenum intro">x</span>
upon their fins and fly out of the Profound; but their wings are soon
dry, and they drop down to the bottom.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id
= "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a></p>

<p>In his preface to <i>The Blazing Comet; or the Beauties of the
Poets</i> (1732), Johnson of Cheshire noted that “the same thought that
makes the Fool laugh, may make the wise Man sigh” (ix). Given such an
equivocal approach to the ways in which the audience responded to his
work, the poet could easily shrug off audience laughter to his most
“Sublime” lines. He was always ready “to leap up in Extasy; and dip ...
[his] Pen in the Sun” (iv). Parts of <i>Hurlothrumbo</i>, particularly
the scene between Lady Flame and Wildfire (both of whom are described in
the list of characters as “mad”) in which Wildfire threatens to cast off
his clothes and “run about stark naked” (48), bear an odd resemblance to
“The King’s Cameleopard” in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. But the
disconnected verbal structure, along with the music and dancing,
achieves a strange mixture that must have amused and, to a certain
extent, bemused its audience.</p>

<p>Johnson called upon “Variety” as his most important artistic
principle, and he developed his ideas on this subject in <i>A Vision of
Heaven</i> (1738), a&nbsp;work which bears a striking resemblance to
William Blake’s <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> Johnson argues that all
surface appearances are merely a form of “Hieroglyphic” concealing a
true vision of things (6). His narrator is capable of what Blake was to
call “mental flight,” and there is a particularly vivid passage in which
the stars are seen as throwing down “freezing Daggers” at the poor
starving children in the streets and another in which we encounter an
aged woman who wields a broom against spiders and against all the young
women who threaten to come near the narrator (26).<a class = "tag" name
= "tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> The mystic temperament is
often capable of making connections between the spiritual and the
excremental,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href =
"#note11">11</a> between the sublime and the bathos of “Thunder-bolts
from Anus.” Blake, we should recall, has poems depicting himself
defecating.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a></p>

<p>Whether Johnson actually collected <i>The Merry-Thought</i> or not,
the reasons for the association of these volumes with his name should
then be clear enough. While Fielding might appropriate the title
“Scriblerus Secundus” by way of staking out a line of descent for his
humor and satire, Hurlothrumbo was so thoroughly connected with Johnson
and his play that I can see no reason why he should not be considered
the likely editor of such a varied and eccentric collection of verse and
prose as <i>The Merry-Thought</i>. That the “Variety” bears no
<span class = "pagenum intro">xi</span>
resemblance to that of serious art, however, should be as obvious as the
difference between a William Blake and a Samuel Johnson of Cheshire. As
William Hogarth was to remark, “variety uncomposed, and without design
is confusion and deformity.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13"
href = "#note13">13</a></p>

<p>Of course, miscellanies by their very nature are likely to be
organized according to principles of variety. What makes <i>The
Merry-Thought</i> different from those appealing to polite taste is the
wide swings of emotion that prompt the writers of these poems and catch
the compiler’s fancy. As we have seen, the verses themselves vary from
the grossest comments on shit to the most passionate expressions of
love. That the one is likely to appear on the walls of latrines and the
other to be cut in glass by a diamond is part of what Johnson would have
called the “Hieroglyphic” significance of this collection. In Johnson’s
plays, there is the odd mixture of vulgarity and sublimity, the comic
and the serious, the satirical and the nonsensical. If his dramas bear a
resemblance to Jarry’s <i>Ubu Roi</i>, so <i>The Merry-Thought</i>
resembles the kind of anthology that Jarry might have put together to
illustrate the absurd anarchy of the human spirit. Johnson, on the other
hand, regarded this seeming anarchy of human thoughts and feelings
optimistically as an emblem of human spirituality.</p>

On the other hand, the willingness of publishers to bring out such
material would have suited well enough with Pope’s picture of their
heroic games. See Alexander Pope, <i>The Dunciad</i>, ed. James

See, for example, W.&nbsp;H. Auden’s “Academic Graffiti,” in

graffiti, but like ordinary graffiti it remains essentially “unpoetic”:
“Lord Byron / Once succumbed to a Siren. / His flesh was weak, / Hers
Greek.”</p>

Michael Treadwell has demonstrated that the “trade publishers” of the
eighteenth century, such as James Roberts, acted almost exclusively as
binders and distributors of books and were therefore different in kind
from the printers and booksellers, who were directly involved in the
selection and production process. Roberts and the other “trade
publishers” dealt almost exclusively in “works belonging to others,” and
Treadwell singles out Roberts as the purest example. Despite putting his
name to “literally thousands of works,” he never purchased any of the
copyrights on works during his long career. See “London Trade
Publishers, 1675-1750,” <i>Library</i>, 6th ser., 4 (1982): 99-134.</p>

it, and made a Specimen, and

so went with it in a Chair to the Opera-House, to give it the better
Grace. But that would not do neither; for one did not understand
<i>Greek</i>; nor t’other did not understand <i>Greek</i>; and

we could make no Bargain, and I returned Home.</p>

Infancy, and you shall curse yourselves before you have it compleat; but
that you shall know what Fools you have been, I’ll stick a Needle
through my Nose, that you may look sharp; and then you will say, why did
not US take it, for in the first Scene I saw all the Audience laugh. But
to the Point, <i>i.e.</i> the second Preamble or Argument,</p>


<h4 class = "extended">OPERA.</h4>

<p class = "prose">
Scene is the City of <i>Athens</i>, and an old Woman lives in a hollow
Tree, where she sells Gin and Gingerbread to the Grenadiers; her Name is
Gammer <i>Hocus</i>. Then there comes a Goddess, who sells Butter and
Eggs at <i>Athens</i> Market, upon her Uncle’s bald Mare; and as the
Mare is a stumbling Jade, so she falls down before <i>Hocus</i>’s Tree,
and hurts her Rump, and then we begin.</p>

<p class = "prose">
<i>N. B.</i> When the Goddess <i>Cinderaxan</i> falls down before Gammer
<i>Hocus</i>’s Door, or Tree, she begins in <i>Ricitativo</i><span class

is purposely to acknowledge the Obligations I owe to several Gentlemen,
who have shewn their Esteem of the <span class = "smallcaps">Merry
Thought</span>, in the large Collections they have communicated before
the Holidays: For who knows, but many of their Pieces might have been
lost, by the Effects of Wine, Punch, and strong Beer, in the
<i>Christmas</i> Time; or by a Game at Ramps, or Blind-Man’s-Buff; or
unlucky Boys; or the sticking the Windows with Holley and Ivy: All these
Hazards did we run of having many curious Pieces destroy’d, and bury’d
in Oblivion. And then again, the Cleaning the Windows against the
Holidays might have endanger’d the Loss of many of these brittle Leaves
of Wit and Learning. But now, we may sing <i>Old Rose</i>, since a large
Cargoe is already arriv’d safe at the Press. In order for a third Part,
I&nbsp;have myself taken Care to visit most of the Glasiers in Town
where I just came Time enough to save some few Scraps of Wit; and have
bribed a great Number of Football-Players, not to use that Diversion
near some particular Places about this Great City, where many curious
Epigrams, Sonnets, and Whims, are at present uncopy’d; and if they
should escape a few Days longer, will make a fourth Volume, with the
kind Assistance of those Correspondents who have sent me promissory
Notes for the Delivery of certain Parcels of such Wit, on or about the
Twenty-fifth of this Instant <i>January</i>. I&nbsp;remain, Gentlemen,
after hoping you are in good Health, as I am at this present Writing,
and wishing you all many happy Years,</p>
